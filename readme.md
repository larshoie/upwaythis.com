### Now with gulp! Yay!
- Compiles, [autoprefixes](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and minifies your [Sass](http://sass-lang.com).
- Uglifys (minifies) your JS
- Minifies your HTML
- Compresses your Images
- Generates a [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) URL for you to access on all devices for testing. Automagically refreshes and syncs all of them.

### Getting started

1. [Clone](https://github.com/larshoie/upwaythis.com.git) the repo or [download](https://github.com/larshoie/upwaythis.com/archive/master.zip).
2. Fire up terminal and `cd` into your folder. (drag and drop the folder if you're lazy/efficient)
3. Run: `npm install` (This will build your packages)
4. Then run: `gulp`(This will build your assets and generate your BrowserSync URL)
5. Enjoy the robots.

### Deploy
[`Surge`](http://surge.sh) or copy the contents of the dist folder to wherever.

(Gulpfile based on the amazing gulp starter by Joe Richardson.)
